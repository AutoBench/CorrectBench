stage 1:

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the golden RTL codes in verilog. In testbench you should compare the signals from golden RTL and DUT. If not the same, then this DUT fails in the test.
Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements from the problem description.
2. you are in section 4. in this section, you will be provided with test scenarios and golden DUT. please highly based on these information to generate the testbench.
3. In the scenarios testing part, do not directly write the value of expected value, but generate expected value from golden RTL.
4. your information is:

your testbench template is:
[testbench template]

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]

IMPORTANT - golden RTL: (please instantiate it in your testbench. Your code should not contain the full code of golden RTL)
[module code]

very very IMPORTANT: If all the test cases pass, the testbench should display "all test cases passed". If any one of the test cases fails, testbench should not display "all test caess passed". 
please don't reply other words except the testbench codes.
