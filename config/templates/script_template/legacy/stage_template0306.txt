stage 1:

[json_mode: True]
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]

your response must be in JSON form. example:

{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

stage 2:

[json_mode: True]

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]
[response from stage 1][JSON]

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

stage 3:

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 3. in this section, please give me the rules of an ideal DUT. you should give these rules in python. Later we will use these ideal rules to generate expected values in each test scenario. currently you must only generate the rules. the input of these rules should be related to the test vectors from test scenario. the rule should give the expected values under test vectors. 
3. your information is:

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]

[response from stage 1][JSON]

test scenario: (please note the test vectors below, it will help you determine the input parameters of the rules)
[response from stage 2][JSON]

your response should only contain python code.

stage 3b:

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 3. in this section, please give me the rules of an ideal DUT in verilog. We already have the rules expressed in python. you only need to translate them into verilog. Later we will use these ideal rules to generate expected values in each test scenario in testbench. the input of these rules should be related to the test vectors from test scenario. the rule should give the expected values under test vectors.  You can use system verilog syntax. You can use "function" and "task" sentences.
3. your information is:

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]

[response from stage 1][JSON]

test scenario: (please note the test vectors below, it will help you determine the input parameters of the rules)
[response from stage 2][JSON]

IMPORTANT:
[response from stage 3]

please translate the python codes into verilog. please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.

///////////////////////////////
stage 4:

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors
- 1.5. the expected results generator in verilog whose output signal will be compared with DUT's corresponding output
Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements from the problem description.
2. you are in section 4. in this section, you will be provided with test scenarios and expected results generator. please highly based on these information to generate the testbench.
3. There should be a reg "error". It is "0" at the beginning. In each scenario, if test fails, the error should become "1" permanently and testbench should print like "scenario ... failed, got ..., expected ...". At the end of the test, if the "error" is still "0", testbench should print "All test cases passed!". This is very important!
4. In the scenarios testing part, do not directly write the value of expected value, but generate expected value from expected results generator.
5. your information is:

[problem description from HDLBits]
[module header]

[response from stage 1][JSON]

IMPORTANT - test scenario:
[response from stage 2][JSON]

IMPORTANT - expected reults generator:
(you MUST use the codes below in your testbench!!!)
[response from stage 3b]

please only generate the verilog codes, no other words. don't forget to print "All test cases passed!" if "error" is 0 at the end!
